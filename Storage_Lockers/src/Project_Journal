Requirements
● Use GitHub issues for the work. See end of this document.
● You must include a project journal with your submission. [X]
● The user is presented with the main menu. [X]
● The user has three options: rent a locker, open a renter locker, or release
(un-rent) a locker.
● When renting, the user is automatically assigned the next available locker
number and assigned a PIN.
● When there are no lockers available, the application should remove the option to
rent a locker.
● The user can open a locker when they enter the associated locker number and
PIN.
● The user can release the locker by entering the associated locker number and
PIN.
● Releasing a locker requires an "Are you sure?" confirmation.
● Apply the DRY principle (as much as possible).
● Each feature should be isolated into a separate method.
● PINs should be 4 digits long. [X]
● PINs should include leading 0's. [X]
● The PIN should be a 'string' (not an 'int'). [X]
● Use an array for the lockers and their associated PINs (or null value when
available).
